Performance Analysis: Year-over-Year 
--------------------------------------------------
Summary:
    Evaluate yearly product performance, comparing against both:
    - Product's average sales
    - Previous year's sales (YoY)
    - CTE for yearly aggregation
    - Window functions for comparison and trends
